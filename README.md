# llm-benchmarks 

Go straight to the [simple math benchmark](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/llm-benchmarks/tree/main/math) ^_^


#### Introduction

Welcome to the llm-benchmarks repository! This repository is dedicated to providing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs), with a focus on mathematical capabilities. These benchmarks are designed to assess the performance and accuracy of LLMs in handling various mathematical problems, from simple arithmetic to complex equations.

#### Why Simple Math Benchmarks?

1. **Foundation for Complexity**: Simple mathematical benchmarks provide a baseline for understanding how well an LLM can handle basic arithmetic operations, which are fundamental to more complex mathematical and scientific tasks.

2. **Performance Metrics**: They offer clear metrics for performance evaluation, such as speed, accuracy, and computational efficiency, which are crucial for optimizing algorithms.

3. **Debugging and Improvement**: Identifying weaknesses in basic operations through these benchmarks can guide further improvements in model architecture and training processes.

4. **Comparison Across Models**: Simple benchmarks allow for straightforward comparisons between different models, helping users select the right model for their specific needs based on empirical data.

5. **Educational Tool**: They serve as an excellent educational tool for new users who are learning about LLMs and their applications in computational mathematics.
